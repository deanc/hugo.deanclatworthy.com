    title: "Warren County Schools"
    description: "The Warren County Schools project was one of the biggest I had undertaken to date. The website was initially pitched to me with a detailed functional specification of how the site should work, and some design mockups. Working closely with my friends from VisualZen, I took their designs and implemented them using semantically correct, accessible, table-less designs. From there I developed a custom content management system which powered the whole front-end of the site via a control panel. Front-end features included a private portal for staff and board members, a calendar system and much more."
