      Have you ever wondered about the difference in language you use to talk to boys and girls? We created a predictive
      keyboard app which adjusts the language you use to talk about girls. For this project I developed the website for the
      campaign (not the app).

      For the second part of Machine Conversations, we were tasked with promoting the launch of KONE's 24/7 Escalator
      maintenance product. In order to do this we hooked an escalator into the same back-end system created for the original
      machine conversations in order to allow the escalator to tweet.

      We also filmed using 360 cameras an escalator ride, in order to embed a VR simulation of riding an escalator to the
      website.

      Our pitch was to bring KONE's 24/7 connected services offering to life
      in the form of converting the messages sent by their elevators into a live chat between the elevator
      and KONE's Cloud maintenance. This was a huge undertaking involving close liason with KONE's R&D team.


      Messages are forwarded from IBM Bluemix to a listening service which stores all messages and adds them into
      an Amazon SQS queue. A series of worker processes then consume queue items and convert them into text
      conversations and their respective audio. The website then consumes these messages from an API and displays
      them.


      An interesting part of this process is how to go from raw data into chat messages. Messages are represented
      as a JSON object featuring all kinds of sensor data including what is happening to the elevator (moving floors, doors opening/closing etc.)
      and then things such as the speed of the elevator and the vibration. This JSON is decoded and then fed into
      Symfony's expression language. This allows content editors to generate chat messages based on what is actually
      happening in the message. For example an expression might look like so:
      `elevator.stop_floor >= 0 and elevator.duration >= 5 and elevator.duration <= 35` and the corresponding chat
      message might be: `Arrived on floor elevator.stop_floor. Travel took elevator.duration seconds.` This allows
      us to generate an unlimited amount of variation of content for the chat.

      Similar to the Fazer Chocolate Hunt project, we utilised a database of outdoor shelter
      locations to create pins on a map that people and their families could visit during the winter months leading up
      to the world skiijumping championships - in order to claim the chance to win a range of prizes.

      We retrofitted an old English phone box with a fake phone, powered by Skype, in order to allow visitors to a complaint
      booth to vent their general frustrations to a moderator on the other end of the phone. If the moderator determined
      the complaint was interesting, they were able to remotely print a free cruise voucher using an internet-connected receipt printer.


      We also created a banner which was featured on the front-page of many of Finland’s most popular websites, allowing
      people to complaint about their day - and be emailed a free cruise by moderators if the complaint was interesting.
      The banner served millions of views over the course of 5 days.

      * a mobile phone powered slot machine to give away great prizes (made by me).

      more efficient.
