On this page I'll detail my areas of expertise.

## Back-end

#### Node.js

JS is everywhere nowadays, with the back-end no exception. I've worked at startups, and at project-level
building back-end services in NodeJS with a strong preference for Typescript.

#### Serverless architecture

More recently I have worked on projects using Serverless framework, deployed to Lambda @ AWS.

#### PHP

I've over 20 years of experience using PHP. I took an early interest in the language when trying to 
modify forum software. Since then I've specialised in it, and built more websites than I can count 
with it. The PHP ecosystem has changed drastically in the last few years. Gone are the days of 
includes, magic quotes and addslashes and PHP now has a fantastic toolset to build modern, maintainable and quick web applications. We now have namespaces, dependency management and incredibly well built components
that can be put together to quickly and efficiently build applications.

I particularly like working with [Symfony](http://symfony.com/).

I've experience working with a few of the major CMS's such as [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) &
[Drupal](http://drupal.org).

#### MySQL

I've worked on MySQL databases for the majority of my career - after all, you need somewhere to store data. I've dealt
with tables with 100s of millions of rows, working feverishly to optimise queries using indexes and balance load across
multiple MySQL servers.

I couldn't have learnt so much without this brilliant book: [High Performance MySQL](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022343.do)

## Front-end

Throughout my career I've often been responsible for developing the front-end of many of my projects as well as the
back-end. I like to think that my front-end skillset is equally as sharp as my back-end skillset. I've been writing
HTML & CSS for so long I remember having to support Internet Explorer 5. Fortunately those days are over and now I spend
that kind of time debugging why webkit keeps flickering animations, or an android browser is performing animations
slowly.

I've plenty of experience writing vanilla Javascript, but am familiar with many JS frameworks including:
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) & others.

## Cloud

I am an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/92fb903a-4ae2-45d7-a1ee-c0203669f67a/public_url) and [AWS Certified Cloud Practioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/a03fa404-283d-469d-8d65-f74c7b970bfa/public_url).


## Systems architecture & design

One of the most important skills I have learned to focus on is planning and system design. It is important to plan and
design a system that will meet all the goals of the project. This can often include making sure the application is
designed in such a way that it's easily maintained and modified, that it scales and that it takes into account potential
problems that may occur further down the line. Having had many years of experience I have learnt to identify very early
on in the life cycle of a project what potential pitfalls might occur and address the risks before they happen.

## Misc

#### Mobile application development

I have used react native to build a few small mobile applications.

#### Misc programming languages

Whilst not my no.1 programming languages, I have experimented and used the other following programming languages:

- Java
- Bash
- C#.NET
- Lisp
- C++
