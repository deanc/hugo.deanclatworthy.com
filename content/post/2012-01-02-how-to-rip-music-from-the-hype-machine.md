Occasionally on the [Hype Machine][1], a song is linked to in an external blog that no longer exists or the path has changed. If the song works when clicking play on HM then there's a simple way to find out the URL and download it using Google Chrome as your browser.

1.  Load up Chrome, and press Ctrl+Shit+I to open the WebKit Inspector.
2.  Go to the network tab then go to the relevant HM page. If nothing appears in the Network tab refresh the page again. Wait a while for everything to appear.
3.  Click the &#8220;clear&#8221; button at the bottom of the network window (it looks like a forbidden icon and it's to the left of where it says &#8220;All&#8221;)
4.  Then move your mouse over the play button on HM and click it.
5.  You should see a few things scroll in the &#8220;Network&#8221; window and one of those will be the MP3 file. Right click it and open in a new tab. Chrome will begin to play the mp3. Right click it and click &#8220;Save as&#8221; and bada bing bada boom you have your MP3 :)

Enjoy!
