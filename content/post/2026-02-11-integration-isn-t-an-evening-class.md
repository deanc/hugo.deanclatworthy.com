I have lived in Finland for 16 years. When I arrived, I failed hard at learning the language.

Classes were only available in the evenings. I would go from work straight to class, sacrificing the very things that make integration possible: friendships, hobbies, community. I was spending all my time learning a language in order to integrate, without having any time to actually integrate.

There was no structured plan. No tailored support. I was close to leaving.

I often think back to that time when someone questions how I have lived here so long without speaking Finnish fluently. The conversation almost always comes up. It carries an undertone, as if I owe something. As if I need to justify my presence.

And I do feel shame sometimes.

But I also feel anger.

What many Finns do not realise is that there is no meaningful integration pathway for people like me. I arrived as a young, highly skilled professional in a sector where Finnish was not required to succeed. I built a career. I worked in incredible teams with warm, talented people. By most definitions, I have been successful.

And yet, career progression has been narrower than it would have been if I were Finnish or fluent. There is data on this. It is not anecdotal.

So I was faced with a choice: stall my professional momentum to study a language I did not strictly need to survive in my field, or continue building my career and accept the ceiling.

That is not really a choice. It is a trade-off.

Some argue the solution is to open more jobs to English. I do not think that is it.

First, many people here simply do not want to work in English, and they should not have to. I have been in meetings where colleagues refused to switch languages. That creates distance. It creates tiers of information. You receive the summary later, not the influence in the moment.

Second, not everyone speaks English well enough to work comfortably in it. Forcing that shift creates its own inequality.

So no, the answer is not to avoid Finnish.

The answer is to invest in it properly.

Right now, the typical solution is a subsidised language course for an hour or two a week. That is not serious. Language proficiency takes thousands of hours. One hour a week for a year might get you small talk at the coffee machine. It will not get you into strategic meetings or leadership roles.

And if you have children, good luck doing it in your free time.

If Finland is serious about integration, especially for skilled immigrants it actively recruits, it needs to treat language acquisition as infrastructure.

Why not create structured integration plans for skilled professionals? Why not allow a reduced four day working week for a year, with one fully funded day dedicated to intensive language study? This would not be charity. It would be an investment.

We already accept study leave as legitimate. Why is language integration, which directly affects participation in society and the economy, treated as a personal hobby?

Right now, Finland has skilled people who are underutilised or sidelined. At the same time, there are labour shortages in multiple sectors. The country will continue to rely on skilled immigrants.

If we want them to succeed, we need to create real pathways, not just expectations.

Integration is not an evening class. It is a long term investment.

And investments require commitment on both sides.
