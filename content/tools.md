As a programmer, I like to experiment and build tools to help make my life or others lives easier. On this page you'll
find some of the tools I have built.

### Silex starter pack

A boilerplate project to get you started quickly with the Silex PHP template. Features include:

- Clearly defined application hierarchy and structure.
- Admin control panel controller, with styling out the box using using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
- Template for loading console tasks.
- A basic Symfony2 Security Component implementation.

[The project is hosted on Github](https://github.com/deanc/silex-starter-pack).
