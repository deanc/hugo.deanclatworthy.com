After working on projects with my clients, I like to ask them about how they felt the project went, and if I delivered what they needed. Here is a small list of feedback that I receieved:


### Andrew Robins

> Dean joined my team at School Stickers, and then subsequently at Vizwoz, in 2007 /08. Joining as a member of a small team, Dean proved himself from the first day to be a highly dependable member of staff, imaginative in his approach to problem solving, and indeed flagging up potential problems we had not foreseen. He has a propensity to think &#8220;outside the box&#8221; which was highly appreciated in his time with us, and is a highly personable, communicative chap, quick to learn, and always met deadlines. I would highly recommend him.


### Simon Day, npower

> Dean is one of the most talented CSS/HTML coders I’ve come across. No matter what npower put in front of him he was able to code with precision and skill. All his work was cross browser compatible and I was genuinely sorry when he left. I have not come across anyone else in my career who can code as well as Dean.


### Peter Van den Wyngaert, Ultrashock

> Dean is a rare super adaptable guy to work with who keeps his promises!

### Onne Stark

> Dean offered his services when he just started out in the business. His persistence and knowledge made him a great admin at my site. Full of creative ideas and actually making results by establishing them. He took RapSearch to a new and more professional level. The design is great and the programming work is even better. The battle system he created for the boards is one of a kind and the best one out there.


### Robert Dalgleish

> I left a request for help to install a hack on my VB forum, previously I nearly lost my forum as I tried to install it myself. Dean replied, his fee was very reasonable and the hack was installed in minutes. Very fast and professional work for less than most charge.

### Leonid Kogan

> High quality work done with care and fast! Dean integrated a journal system into our vBulletin forum. He was quick and professional and the end result was exactly what we wanted. I Would recommend Dean for any difficult, or time-sensitive job. If you are looking for efficiency and dedication, Dean is your man!

### Steven Rolph

> I hired Dean to design a series of graphics for our website. He was given a strict deadline to complete the project and not only did he complete it two days ahead of schedule, but he delivered a standard of work more impressive than we had imagined. Dean&#8217;s great to work with, takes into account all of your needs, and intertwines them with his areas of expertise to deliver exactly what you want. I&#8217;d reccomend him to anyone!

### Ken Iovino, ComputerProblems.org

> I just want to start by saying that his speed is what impressed me the most. And the customer service was excellent. We Hired Dean to add some features to our homepage portal. And let me tell you, The company and I were more than impressed. Dean is now the one source we turn to if we need anything extra added to our extending network of websites.

### Scott Israel

> I don&#8217;t normally write testomonials, however in this case I am more than happy to. Dean designed and set us up with a unique script to pull information from our forums to be displayed on our home page. I was very impressed with his courtesy and turn around time, which was less than one day! Dean is very knowledgeable and professional and he addressed all of our needs. I was even more impressed with his follow-up. He was prompt and professional and really helped us when new problems arose or needed advice. I&#8217;d recommend him to anyone!

### Ryan Logtenberg, MyTravelGuide.com

> Dean has been doing contract work for MyTravelGuide.com since November 2003. He has remained punctual with completion dates and conference calls, he has shown creativity in his programming abilities and has remained friendly and open minded with my needs.
