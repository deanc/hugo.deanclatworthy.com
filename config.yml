    Intro: |
      Greetings! I'm originally from England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 but now I live in Helsinki, Finland 🇫🇮. I've a BSc. in Computer Science
      and I've been building things with computers now for as long as I can remember. I particularly enjoy building web applications -
      and I specialise in both back-end and front-end web application development in the cloud.
      I have a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/deanc">Github profile</a>, where you can see some of my code. You can also reach me on
      <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/deanclatworthy">Twitter</a>, or fill in the <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a> and I'll try
      to mail you back.
